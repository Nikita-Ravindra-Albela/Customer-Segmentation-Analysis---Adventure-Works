# 👥 Customer Segmentation Dashboard (RFM Model) – Power BI

This project provides a Power BI dashboard that segments customers using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model. The goal is to help businesses identify and engage different customer segments with data-driven marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Segment customers based on:
  - **Recency** – How recently a customer made a purchase
  - **Frequency** – How often they purchase
  - **Monetary** – How much they spend
- Visualize customer segments using Power BI.
- Enable targeted actions to improve retention and sales.

## 🧮 How RFM Scoring Works

- Each customer is scored from 1 to 5 for:
  - **Recency**: Lower values mean longer since last purchase.
  - **Frequency**: Higher values mean frequent transactions.
  - **Monetary**: Higher values indicate more spending.
- Customers are grouped into segments using the combined RFM score.
